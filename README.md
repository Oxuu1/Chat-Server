# Main Issues

Replit dont allow connection to the server working on it 

Playit still not working still working on a fix

Ban System is broken still i might just remove it for now

# Fix

Fixed it so its harder to bypass ban words

Fixed being banned and still able to join that no longer works it will just take you to you own server
